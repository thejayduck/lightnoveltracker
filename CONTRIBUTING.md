# Contributing to NovelTracker
Thank you for your interest in contributing to NovelTracker

## Ways to contribute
### Bug Reports
We welcome all bug reports. It's better to have a duplicate report than a missing one so don't worry about that.

When filing a bug report, make sure that you provide as much information as possible. Most important is to specify what browser you are using.

### Code Contributions, Pull Requests (PRs)
Make sure you try to follow the style used elsewhere in the project.

#### Features Additions
Before writing a feature, make sure that someone opened an issue beforehand so the details can be discussed.
#### Bug Fixes
Mention the bug that you are fixing in the PR 

For example:

```
Fixes #123
By adding an additional check, the error should no longer occur
```
#### Misc Fixes (comment, documentation, etc)
While these are good, they are not that important. We would prefer if you could bundle multiple of these changes into one PR.
